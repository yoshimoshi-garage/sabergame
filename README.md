# Saber Game Saber Speed Training Aid

Saber Game is a simple hardware training tool to allow two fencers to comete against each other in off-the-line speed.  A director calls "fence" and the first fencer to touch a mask centered between them gets a point.

Everything needed to create or even improve the training aid will be included in this repository once it's complete.

There will be code, bill-of-materials, hardware layouts and CAB files for printing the enclosure.

PRs, feature requests, bug fixes, etc. are all welcome.
